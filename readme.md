This is a just backup of my **vim(gvim)** .

**It Will Remove All Your Settings Before**

I made a `install` file on platform **ubuntu x64** to direct you apply these settings on your computer. 

**Focus That:**. It is just a guide. I suggest you install it hand-actuated. Otherwise you can run the file `install`, just maybe get some mistake.
